/**
 * Builds the regex (as a serializable string) that the browser client uses to
 * scan the DOM for Bible references — and the name→slug map the client uses
 * to build midvash.com URLs without shipping the full books table.
 *
 * Previously the client pattern was non-capturing because the client only
 * needed to know *where* a reference was, then shipped the raw text to
 * `/lookup`. Since v0.3.0 the client also has to build a real `<a href>` in
 * the client-only fallback (SEO — issue #49), so it needs to extract the
 * book name + chapter + verse from the match. The pattern is now CAPTURING,
 * with the same shape as the SSR pattern in `linkify.ts` / `parser.ts`:
 *   m[1] = book name (matched form)
 *   m[2] = chapter
 *   m[3] = verse (optional)
 *   m[4] = verseEnd (optional, for ranges like "3:16-18")
 *
 * The pattern includes the configured language's names PLUS English (authors
 * often mix languages, and Latin abbreviations like "Gn"/"Jo" are universal).
 *
 * The `buildNameToSlug` helper returns a small object keyed by normalized
 * book name (NFD, accent-stripped, lowercased) → English slug. The client
 * uses it to resolve the matched name to the slug for URL construction.
 *
 * Previously `buildClientPattern` was copy-pasted into `runtime.ts` and
 * `sandbox-entry.ts`; both now import from here.
